# WanderHub-A-Smart-Tourism-Platform

## Introduction
- WanderHub is an intelligent tourism platform developed to revolutionize how travelers plan and experience their journeys. 
- By utilizing data-driven insights and cutting-edge optimization algorithms, WanderHub personalizes hotel recommendations and travel itineraries based on each user’s unique preferences, such as budget, activities, and health considerations. 
- Recognizing the limitations of traditional platforms, which often fail to address individual needs effectively, WanderHub employs Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing to create customized travel plans, reducing the time and effort needed for manual planning.
- This approach enhances traveler satisfaction and makes the planning process both seamless and enjoyable. 
- An essential feature of WanderHub is its use of Counterfactual Analysis, allowing users to explore alternative scenarios by modifying specific travel parameters, such as budget or hotel ratings. 
- This “what-if” functionality offers flexibility and adaptability, empowering users to make well-informed choices suited to changing travel conditions. 
- By integrating these smart capabilities, WanderHub addresses key pain points in the tourism industry, such as decisional fatigue and information overload, offering a comprehensive solution that benefits both travelers and tourism providers.

## Problem Statement
A huge challenge in the tourism industry lies in being able to offer customized, efficient travel planning solutions. Much time is lost in manual planning and subsequently leads to suboptimal choices because of information overload and the complexity of balancing numerous preferences, including budget, activities, accommodations, and health considerations. The current systems do not involve itinerary planning, make generic recommendations with no regard for the interests of each traveler, nor allow for the analysis of specific alternative scenarios involving specific constraint. This is associated with traveler dissatisfaction, decisional fatigue affecting 65 % of travelers, inefficient utilization of resources, and potential business lost in the tourism industries. The Intelligent Tourism Recommendation System would address such major challenges by creating a joined-up platform that not only includes AI-driven optimization capabilities for the itinerary but personalizes hotel recommendations as well as enables counterfactual analysis. The solution will actually help these travelers make the right decision, and tourism businesses better understand their clients' needs.

## Research Objectives
- To develop a recommendation system that suggests hotel details based on user preferences.
- To develop a counterfactual-based recommendation system providing alternative options if any “What-if” scenario arises.
- To design and implement a hybrid Genetic Algorithm-Simulated Annealing approach to optimize travel itineraries based on user preferences.
